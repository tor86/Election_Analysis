Overview of Election Audit:Â Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis
---
The purpose of this analysis was to help Tom in collecting voting results in a Colorado precinct. Using Python and .csv files to create readable and writeable scripts that store data from files and arrays. Also, using mathematical operations to tally votes and find percentages for not only the candidates but also the counties where the votes were cast. Created logical operations and repetition statments to run through the code more than once to get a complete vote count. Takikng our findings and being able to produce screen output in .txt format.

Election-Audit Summary
---
While the code used in this Pyhton script gave an output for this particular congressional election, this code can be used across multiple counties and elections. The code is easily modified to produce output for counties and candidates pulling .csv files and changing names where applicaable. Can also use this code and use logical operations and repetition statements to see a breakdown of which county favors which candidate, can also be used other elections to assist parties in knowing where their votes come from or don't come from.
